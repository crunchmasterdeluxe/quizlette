# Overview
A fun adaptation of Quizlet in Django (renamed Quizzlette for CopyRight reasons)

## Startup Instructions
These instructions assume that you have python3 running on your OS.
1. First, create a virtual environment on your OS. Run `python3 -m venv quiz` for example. Then run `cd quiz`, and lastly `source bin/activate`. You have now created and activated your virtual env.
2. Next, install Django. Run `pip3 install Django`. This will give you the basic Django framework and its libraries.
3. To run on your local server, run `python3 manage.py runserver`.
4. If you make any changes to models.py, you must update the database to reflect those changes. You can do so by running `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and then `python3 manage.py migrate`

# Development Environment
